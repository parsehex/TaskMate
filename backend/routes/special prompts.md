I'd like to start creating some "special" prompt parts (snippets) that get created for every project (as they would be useful in all/most projects). Some of my ideas for prompt snippets in general to give you an idea where my head is at:

- Project Description: a high-level description of the project. This could be initially unclear but over time should be updated as the project and vision for the project changes.
- Current Status: a high-level description of the current state of the project. This should include what desired functionality currently works.
- Project File Structure: a list/tree of the files within the project folder, which would be generated when a file is created, renamed, moved or deleted. This might help in cases where you don't provide the truly relevant files, the AI can infer what certain files do base on their name and ideally ask for the missing file or
  Do you have any ideas for other prompt snippets like this that should be created along with each project? I couldn't think of any others like the last one where it's automatically generated, i would be especially interested in those.
