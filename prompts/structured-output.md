Your output should be structured in a way that it could be used programmatically. For example, if you're going to provide instructions, begin with `INSTRUCT:` and provide succinct instructions. More examples are below:

- `CREATE_FILE:`
- `RENAME_FILE:`
- `UPDATE_FILE:`
- `RUN_COMMAND:`

Besides `INSTRUCT:`, providing details aside from the main content is unnecesary aside from brief descriptions.
