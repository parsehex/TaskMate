# TaskMate (Work in Progress)

This is a web / Electron app to assist with my own usage of LLMs to pair program on projects.

You have a list of Snippets which are just string of text that you can edit, and you have Files within the selected project folder. By selecting Snippets + Files, the app combines the text into a single prompt, providing an easy way to reuse common parts of the prompt (e.g. instructions, common tasks).

If you're familiar with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), this app is kind of a way to perform RAG manually.
