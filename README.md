# Query Craft

This is a web app to assist with constructing prompts that get sent to an LLM in a project-centric way.

You have a list of Snippets which are just string of text that you can edit, and you have Files within the selected project folder. By selecting Snippets + Files, the app combines the text into a single prompt, providing an easy way to reuse common parts of the prompt (e.g. instructions, common tasks).
