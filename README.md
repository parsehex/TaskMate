## What is this?

This project aims to assist in constructing prompts from text snippets and files. It's intended as a tool to help developers working on a project to construct prompts to send to an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude.

There is a section for snippets as well as a section listing the files in a chosen project. You can select a combination of snippets and files to construct a prompt which can be copied to the clipboard.

Projects can be added to the set projects folder and changes to the folder will be reflected in the app.
